# Senior-Design-Project


This is the guts of the software implementation for the Guitar Multi-Effect Pedal Senior Design Project (Fall 2019) 


cyren-simple-client.c is the file containing the threading & function definitions for the software effects & the JACK (library) audio routing.


BASICfftw.c is the code that was used in the early stages of development to test the effects on discrete time samples
